[Sweet Spot & Content Tilt]

The sweet spot is where your area of expertise intersects with your audience's demands. 
At the intersection of these two circles, including 'content tilt', your unique and competitive 'content' that lies in the area where these three circles meet appears to be both the source of revenue and the target of marketing.
Content Tilt is a crucial concept in content marketing strategy. It refers to a unique angle or approach that differentiates your content from competitors. Content Tilt is about finding a distinctive area of content creation where you have little or no competition.

Listening to the audience's desires and using them as a foundation to determine the 'mission and vision' of your content business and then developing marketing activities seems to be a solid first step. 
Expanding from the traditional marketing areas of products and services, 'content' seems to be a positive value delivered to customers. 

Therefore, in modern society, I think the essence of marketing in business is to act as a brand persona and use content as a medium to form positive relationships with the audience and exchange value.
